# mediaStream to hdfs and kafka error
Cannot find earliest offsets of Set(media_keyStream01-0). Some data may have been missed. 
Some data may have been lost because they are not available in Kafka any more; either the
 data was aged out by Kafka or the topic may have been deleted before all the data in the
 topic was processed. If you don't want your streaming query to fail on such cases, set the
 source option "failOnDataLoss" to "false".
